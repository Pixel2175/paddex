## Why Gaza Should Be Free

Gaza, a small strip of land on the Mediterranean coast, has been under an
illegal blockade by Israel since 2007. Its people have suffered deeply under
military occupation, airstrikes, and systematic oppression for decades.

### ● Crimes Against Gaza

  * Bombing of civilians: Thousands of children and families killed in airstrikes targeting homes, schools, and hospitals.
  * Blockade: Gaza is described as the world’s largest open-air prison. The blockade restricts food, medicine, electricity, and construction materials.
  * Sniper shootings: Peaceful protestors have been shot by Israeli snipers during marches like the Great March of Return.
  * Destruction of infrastructure: Repeated attacks have destroyed homes, schools, and water facilities, leaving thousands homeless.
  * Use of white phosphorus: In wars like 2008-2009, Israel used white phosphorus, a chemical weapon banned in civilian areas.

### ● Gaza Deserves Freedom

The people of Gaza are not terrorists — they are teachers, engineers,
children, artists, and dreamers. They deserve to live in dignity and peace,
not under occupation and siege.

// No one is free until Gaza is free.
